<p><b>Critique/Comment: </b>Assignment and About me sections on home page have missing images? The text on the background is a bit hard to read. The spacing on Assignments page is inconsistent. The home page looks a bit cluttered, maybe move the buttons to assignments? Like the use of boxes around text</p>

<p><b>Critique/Comment: </b>Ur website is cool. I love the background for the site. I think u should add the JavaScript exercises to ur assignments page and i thibk u should make a feedback section. Also try to put more computer science memes in ur meme page.</p>

<p><b>Critique/Comment </b>Format your buttons fam, and you should probably put them UNDER the nav bar. I would consider formatting your text to have a simple backdrop if there is a moving background. Also learn how to spell OBJECTIVE....you also have NO general interests? Lastly your title has a black backdrop on a dark background...fix that.</p>
